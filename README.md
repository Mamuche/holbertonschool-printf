Project Printf

Write your own printf function.

Team and Tasks

This project was released by Emma Lateyron and Marion Laroche in Holbertonschool's Bordeaux.
We work on the campus every day and we make a Check in every morning and a Check out every afternoon.
we divided some tasks, but the essential file 'printf' was written in collaboration.

A rebuild of the standard printf function in C. Our project required a function capable of printing with the %d, %c, %s, and %% specifiers to standard output. printf returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte at the end of strings). We were not asked to handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length.


Desciption

* prototype: int _printf(constchar *format, ...);
* the function _printf return the lenght of the input.
* the file main.h contain the structure for the format specifiers.



Format specifiers :

%%, %c, %s, %d, %i 

printf_c_and_s --> contain functions that print a char and an string.
